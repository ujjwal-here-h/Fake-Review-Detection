# Fake-Review-Detection
Online reviews are often the primary factor in a customer’s decision to purchase a product or service, and are a valuable source of information that can be used to determine public opinion on these products or services. Because of their impact, various companies are hiring people to write fake positive reviews about their services or products or unfair negative reviews about their competitors' services or products. The value and credibility of online consumer reviews are compromised by significantly increasing yet difficult-to-identify fake reviews thus it is important to develop techniques for detecting review spam. This project identifies a variety of features from online reviews using NLP followed by building a “super learner” ensemble model to solve the problem of review spam detection. One of the major challenges and difficulties in building a fake review detection model through machine learning lies in acquiring labeled reviews. In this project, Yelp data was used as the ground of truth for training and testing the deception model. The model’s performance was evaluated on various metrics and a comparison was made between performance of various base models and the super learner.
